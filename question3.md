To automate the process of extracting data via an API, I would use a script similar to the one in  [question1.py](question1.py) and employ a task scheduler to run the script at a specified time. The key modification to automate the script is treating the `end_year` as a variable, allowing it to update automatically. By using a task scheduler, I can set the script to run at regular intervals, such as monthly, ensuring continuous and up-to-date data extraction.
